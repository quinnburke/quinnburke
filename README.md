I am a Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Sciences at the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) and a research assistant in the [Security & Privacy Research Group](https://madsp.cs.wisc.edu/), advised by [Prof. Patrick McDaniel](http://patrickmcdaniel.org).

I’m passionate about systems and network security and especially excited by the new problems introduced by emerging confidential computing technology. My current research focuses on designing low-cost defensive techniques in this setting. I like building things! You can find some of my projects here or over at our [MadSP-McDaniel](https://github.com/orgs/MadSP-McDaniel/repositories) page.
